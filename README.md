# AI-Powered-Dynamic-Route-Optimization

# Team lead -- Suresh Tak 
# Team members -- divyaDharshni Nadar, Rehan 
# Project Description: This project aims to optimize the dynamic route planning for a fleet of vehicles.
# It uses a combination of machine learning and graph algorithms to find the most efficient routes.
# The project is divided into three main components: data collection, route optimization, and route visualization.
# The data collection component collects real-time traffic data and vehicle locations.
# The route optimization component uses a machine learning model to predict the most efficient routes based on the collected
# data. The route visualization component displays the optimized routes on a map.
